# ⚡ Forecasting Electricity Production Using ARIMA

This project demonstrates time series forecasting of electricity production using the ARIMA model. We use historical monthly production data to build a predictive model that can forecast future electricity production trends.

## 📊 Project Overview
- **Goal**: Forecast electricity production to improve generation scheduling, maintenance windows, and capacity‑expansion planning.  
- **Data**: Monthly industrial electricity‑production index from Kaggle.  
- **Techniques**  
  - Time‑series cleaning & preprocessing  
  - Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) stationarity tests  
  - Differencing to remove trend/seasonality  
  - ARIMA model development (with pmdarima auto‑tuning)  
  - Model evaluation & forecast visualization
 
## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- statsmodels
- Google Colab

## 📈 Key Steps
1. Loaded and inspected the raw monthly series  
2. Addressed missing or anomalous values  
3. Achieved stationarity via first‑order differencing 
4. Fitted candidate ARIMA model  
5. Forecasted electricity production 12 months ahead  
6. Visualized predictions vs. actuals with confidence intervals

## 📈 Insights

- **Upward Trend Identified**: The electricity production data shows an overall increasing trend over time, indicating rising demand. First-order differencing was applied to make the series stationary.

- **Stationarity Achieved**: The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test initially confirmed non-stationarity. After differencing, the test returned a p-value below 0.05, validating stationarity and model readiness.

- **Optimal ARIMA Model Chosen**: The best (p,d,q) parameters were selected using `pmdarima.auto_arima()` based on AIC score optimization, eliminating the need for manual tuning.

- **Accurate Forecasting**: The trained ARIMA model successfully forecasted the next 24 months of electricity production, aligning well with historical trends and showing consistent seasonality.

- **Residual Analysis**: Model residuals resembled white noise, indicating that the model captured the structure in the data well and did not leave behind autocorrelated errors.

- **Strong Visual Fit**: Forecast plots overlayed with historical data demonstrated a strong match, confirming both visual and statistical validity of the model.

## 🏭 Business Recommendations

- **Capacity Planning**  
  Use forecasted electricity production data to schedule generation capacity in advance, especially during high-demand months to avoid shortages.

- **Maintenance Scheduling**  
  Plan maintenance activities during periods of forecasted low production to minimize operational disruptions and ensure system reliability.

- **Policy & Budget Planning**  
  Leverage the 12-month forecast to align national or regional energy policies, subsidies, and budgeting efforts with expected production trends.

- **Energy Trading & Contracts**  
  Utilities can use forecasts to make data-driven decisions on energy procurement, spot market participation, or long-term power purchase agreements.

- **Renewable Integration**  
  Combine forecasted production with renewable generation planning (solar, wind) to balance load and reduce dependency on non-renewable sources.

- **Model Monitoring**  
  Continuously retrain the ARIMA model with new monthly data to maintain accuracy, detect structural changes, and adapt to evolving demand-supply patterns.
